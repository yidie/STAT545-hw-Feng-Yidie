#### My Goal for STAT 545
* Apply what I have learned from other statistics courses

#### Report Process

2. I save, commit, pull and push to github regularly.
3. Reflection 
- The sample readme file is helpful for beginners. 
- I still need to learn more about r markdown syntax.
- Practice more and make sure to follow the correct workflow.
