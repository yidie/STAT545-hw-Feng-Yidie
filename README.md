### My Goal for STAT 545
* Apply what I have learned from other statistics courses
* Improve my communication skills
* Get more pratice with coding in R
* Work with git and github with more confidence

### Report Process
1. I made these changes locally in R studio.
2. I save, commit, pull and push to github regularly.
3. Reflection 
- The sample readme file is helpful for beginners. 
- I still need to learn more about r markdown syntax.
- Practice more and make sure to follow the correct workflow.
