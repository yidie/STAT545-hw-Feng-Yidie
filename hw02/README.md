## Welcome to Yidie's hw02 folder

### Navigation

This is the folder for hw02 in STAT545-hw01-Feng-Yidie repo. You can go to [here](https://github.com/yidie/STAT545-hw-Feng-Yidie/blob/master/hw02/Explore_gapminder_and_use_dplyr.md) to find my exploration of gapminder and dplyr.

### Process Report
- All the work was done locally in R studio and then commit, pull, push to github.
- ggplot is a much nicer way of presenting graphs than using R basic graphs.
- I have trouble putting the arguments in the right place when I was doing the boxplots. This [tutorial](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/r-ggplot2-boxplot/) was very helpful.
- I am a bit confused about these two concepts: class and data type.
- dplyr functions have intuitive names and this makes it easier to understand them. I still need to practice with more functions in dplyr. It is very useful in manipulating data.
