### Navigation

This is the folder for hw05 in STAT545-hw-Feng-Yidie repo. You can go to [here](https://github.com/yidie/STAT545-hw-Feng-Yidie/blob/master/hw04/Tidy_data_and_joins.md) to find my work on "Factor and figure management".

### Process Report

-   [This](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html) is very helpful on reordering factors.
-   [This](http://stat545.com/block026_file-out-in.html) is very helpful on writing and reading files.
-   Exploring the effects of `arrange()` and `fct_reorder()` on figures made me realize the difference between them and realy understand what does reordering factor levels mean.
-   Reading and writng files in and out of R is very useful. Understanding the features of csv/rds/dput is important so that we know what aspects of the data can be maintained in which file format.
-   ggplot is so powerful! I still need to practice and explore more about it.
