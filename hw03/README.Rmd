This is the folder for hw03 in STAT545-hw-Feng-Yidie repo. You can go to [here](https://github.com/yidie/STAT545-hw-Feng-Yidie/blob/master/hw03/hw03_use_dplyr_ggplot_to_manipulate_and_explore_data.md) to find out what I have done.

### Process Report
- All the work was done locally in R studio and then commit, pull, push to github. I feel comfortable with the workflow now.
- For all three tasks I have done, I first use dplyr functions to get the information I want and give a name to the output dataframe. Then I call this dataframe when I make tables and graphs using ggplot.  
- I use labs function to label all the graphs properly.
- In task 3, I compared geom_line and geom_smooth function. I found that geom_smooth is more convenient when you want to see what the trend looks like, as it automatically smoothes over the data points to give you a line. While for geom_line, I need to first compute the mean across all the countries and then connect them using geom_line.
